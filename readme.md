Restrictions for the exercice:
-----------------------------
1. 300px sidebar cannot change in width. It must be a fixed width.
2. Sidebar must be visible on tablet versions.
3. Middle black column should disappear on tablet sizes and below.

Tools
------
The project uses Yeoman (with grunt and bower) for deployment and package management.

Support
-------
Tested on ie8, 9, firefox, chrome and safari.


How I could have gone further?
------------------------------
- make media queries work for ie8.
- Make images adaptive to not serve big images for small devices.
- change all css background images to base64 to send less http request to server.
- using sprites for css images. This example didn't have much css background images so I just left it like it was.
- make some javascript animation.
